# Project Overview
The Call Center Analysis project aims to optimize call center performance by analyzing key metrics related to agent performance and call characteristics. This project interprets data to identify areas of improvement and to provide actionable insights.

# Data Source
- **Call Center Dataset**: This dataset includes information on agent performance, call duration, customer satisfaction, and other relevant metrics.

# Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Creating dashboards, data visualization.

# Data Preparation
Here's a quick rundown of the steps taken in the project:
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensured the data was clean, organized, and ready for analysis.
2. **Data Modeling**: Structured the data for effective analysis using Power BI.
3. **Data Analysis (DAX)**: Leveraged DAX functions to dig deep into the numbers.
4. **Data Visualization (Dashboard)**: Created visually compelling dashboards to make complex data easily understandable.
5. **Insights**: Unearthed some fascinating findings!

# Insights Summary

**Agent analysis:**
- **Volume and Satisfaction:** 5000 calls received, 4054 answered (81%), with an average satisfaction rating of 3.40/5.
- **Agent Performance:** Becky has the fastest response time (65.3 sec), Diane missed the most calls, Martha has the highest satisfaction rating, and Jim resolved the most issues.
- **Monthly Analysis:** Consistent call volumes and resolutions across February, January, and March, with slight variations in satisfaction and duration.
- **Call Breakdown:** Jim answered the most calls (536) but also had a high number of unanswered calls. Stewart has the highest percentage of unanswered calls.

**Call centre analysis:**
- **Volume and Satisfaction:** 1116 calls received, 890 answered (80%), with an average satisfaction rating of 3.41/5.
- **Issue Resolution:** Payment-related issues take the longest to resolve (6.5 min) but have relatively high satisfaction. Contract-related issues have the lowest satisfaction.
- **Monthly Trends:** February had the highest resolved calls (264), March had the highest unresolved calls (112).
- **Peak Times:** Highest call volume at 11 AM.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations:

- **Training Programs:** Implement targeted training programs to improve agent efficiency and customer handling skills.
- **Resource Allocation:** Adjust staffing during peak call times to ensure adequate coverage and reduce wait times.
- **Performance Incentives:** Introduce performance-based incentives to motivate agents to achieve higher customer satisfaction and first call resolution rates.
- **Process Improvements:** Streamline call handling processes to reduce average call duration and enhance overall efficiency.
- **Customer Feedback:** Collect and analyze customer feedback regularly to identify areas for service improvement.
